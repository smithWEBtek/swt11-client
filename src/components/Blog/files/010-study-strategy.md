**Find resources that work for your learning style.**
  - Videos, books, pdfs, blogs.
  - Seek out expert courses on Udacity, Udemy, Coursera, SitePoint, Tutsplus, etc.  
  - Find a teacher that you can relate to and dive into the topic.

**Get conversant with HELLO WORLD in that topic.**
  - Make repos and push your code as you work the course. 
  - Make folders that match the chapters/sections/modules, so you can come back to it for working code, (this technique put me over the top in a technical challenge to win a job, while I was under time pressure. The code I saved was there to refresh my mind, even though I did not go super deep first time around).

**IMPROVISE a little on the topic, build something that works.**
  - Tie the topics (coding this thing to talk to that thing) together in the most basic way that works. 

**Divide and conquer, Hello World.**
  - There are going to be defined sections of the tech stack you are dealing with. 
  - Together they look too daunting.
  - Separate them and get basic hello world versions working. 

**Start a list of questions you can't solve immediately.** 
  - These are your talking points with senior devs at lunch, hackathons or coding groups. 
  - Example:   I've tied this thing to that thing and they "talk" so far, but I cannot see how to implement "this other thing".  Do you have any ideas I could pursue?
  - This shows them you've done some work and are not just asking for tech support like a whining end user.  It also touches their creative mind and hopefully the nurturing instinct to help you out a bit. 
 
**The best thing you can do is make a list of 20 ways to attack this, then start doing that list.**
  - It will put your creative mind and energy into action. 
  - Fight for a foothold on each technical topic, however small, it is a victory. 

**Skim through documentation and tables of contents first, getting the big picture of how things are put together.**
  - Then get specific about making "hello world" work for that topic. 
  - If you end up with 3 or 4 courses to do, dig in and code everything the instructor codes.
  - Don't do this for 20 topics, but do it for the top 3.

**Periodically go back and skim the table of contents or master list of topics.** 
  - For the top 3 and for the entire 20, skim and get big picture
  - Keep your mind threading on both the big picture, as well as getting "hello world" to work. 

**Many seemingly difficult technical topics boil down to some setup, boilerplate, configuration and specific syntax to tie things together.**
  - The big picture thinking allows you to ask simple questions, which get you started. 
  - Tutorials and videos are often a good way to just get your sense of balance in a particular topic.

**Work like it all depends on  you, getting something basic to work.**
  - Then have the sense and humility to ask for help based on your work. 
  - Finally, if you do these things and still "fail", you have at least demonstrated the grit and determination to work at it, which is an irresistible quality that is hard to find.
