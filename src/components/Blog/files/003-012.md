##PIANO SEARCH - RUBY CLI GEM

Command Line Interface application, using Ruby and NokoGiri to scrape Craigslist, in search of the 2 most popular models of Yamaha piano, the model U2, and the model P22. Similar to buying a Toyota Corolla or Camry, the Japanese made pianos are very solid investments.

### Summary

Version 0.1.0 PianoSearch

Searches Boston Craiglist Musical Instruments for Yamaha P22 or Yamaha U1 pianos for sale.
Prompts user to choose 'Yamaha piano model U1' or 'P22'.

Displays a list, including prices and headlines of existing posts.
Prompts user to choose a post #, to see details.

Displays the Price, Location, Headline and Description (post text) for the chosen post.
Prompts user to choose another post #, or 'list' to restart, or 'x' to exit.

### Business Application

The Ruby Gem PianoSearch is a basic measurement of used piano sales in Boston, to allow a piano dealer insight on the "competition" that exists in the used piano market. Potential buyers all face the decision of whether to buy used or new. The 2 piano models in PianoSearch are good measures of the market, very similar by analogy, to the Toyota Corolla and Toyota Camry in the auto market.

(Basic cars that are Japansese-made and hold their value well.)

### Concept

The idea for this Gem comes from the basic premise that a business should be doing three (3) things with their data.

    1: Measuring what happened
    2. Predicting what will happen
    3. Comparing competitor data.

### #1. Measuring

Measuring what happened, today, yesterday, this week, last month, last year and comparing those time frames in meaningful ways to steer the business.

### #2. Predicting

Deducing from data measurements, the things that will likely happen in the future.

Knowing that your donut shop sells out of chocolate most Friday nights, compared to almost zero chocolate donut sales on most Monday nights, is a valuable insight. This can help cash flow, product freshness and strategic planning for adding more workers on Friday nights, if needed.

### #3. Comparing

Leveraging business data to answer questions both past and future, is essential to any enterprise that measures itself. Comparison data incorporates other data sets into the past and future data so that the business can now answer deeper questions that simply "what happened?" or "what might happen?".

### TECHNICAL FLOW and FUNCTIONALITY in PianoSearch version 0.1.0

Main URLs:
The PianoSearch Gem 0.1.0 is statically coded to the Boston Craigslist Musical Instruments section. This is accomplished with 2 static URLs in 2 separate methods, for scraping the existing post headlines.

Use of Nokogiri

These URL's are scraped using Nokogiri and Open-Uri for both the initial post headlines and the subsequent post details.

Methods in class PianoSearch::Post

[self.scrape_clu1]

    1. Scrapes the main URL for "Yamaha U1", saving results in the @posts array.

    2. Calls the self.scrape_posts method

[self.scrape_clp22]

    1. Scrapes the main URL for "Yamaha P22", saving results in the @posts array.

    2. Calls the self.scrape_posts method

[self.scrape_posts]

    1. Scrapes the @posts array to extract post_id for each post, to be used in creating its URL

    2. Calls the self.create_urls method

[self.create_urls]

    1. Appends the post id to "http://boston.craigslist.org/"<post_ID>.html"

    2. Calls the self.show_headings method

[self.show_headings]

    1. PUTS out a row for each post, including a Post Number and Headline

[self.scrape_detail]

    1. Creates an array (@post_ary) of post hashes, including price, headline, location and description

[self.show_detail(input)]

    1. Takes in the users input choice as an index number

    2. Displays the appropriate post hash corresponding to the user input number

### Methods and Functionality of PianoSearch::CLI

class PianoSearch::CLI workflow
call
start
puts "🎹 Welcome to Boston Craigslist Piano Search 🎹"
puts "Please enter model number u1 or p22"  
 menu shows list of posts for model chosen

                      PianoSearch::Post.show_headings

menu method:
count = PianoSearch::Post.scrape_posts.count (uses count of posts, to limit valid input choices)
puts "Enter [digit] for details, [list] for list, or [exit]."
PianoSearch::Post.scrape_detail (this is run to produce detailed post hashes)
Menu options:
list (calls start)
exit (calls goodbye)
else (invalid entry)
goodbye (puts "🎹 Thank you for searching 🎹")
user input (number) is passed to:
PianoSearch::Post.show_detail(input.to_i-1)
self.show_detail(input)] 1. Takes in the users input choice as an index number 2. Displays the appropriate post hash corresponding to the user input number including price, headline, location and description.

### EXAMPLE:

---

$2250 Beautiful Yamaha Piano (Stoughton)

Piano is a gorgeous Polished Walnut and looks like it has just come from the factory (made in Thomaston, Georgia). One owner, lightly driven by a little old lady. :) Purchased new from Boston Organ and Piano in 1996, Model P22, Serial Number 210067. Includes piano bench - bench has a few dings.

🎹🎹🎹🎹

Future Functionality
Added functionality will include:

1. Choice of user State and Area within that U.S. State to replace the static URL's in current version

   NOTE: Areas are represented by 3 letters immediately preceding the post_id. States are not directly represented in URLs. The syntax is as follows:

   "http://[state_area].craigslist.org/[3 letter area acronym]/[10 digit post_id].html"

2. Use of Ruby Gem: Pony or Mail to provide the user the option of having the search sent daily in email.

3. Expanded details, including DateTime posted, geo-coordinates for GoogleMaps and other post details

4. Reply to capture, providing the foundation for automated outreach to ads proposing to buy the pianos at a pre-determined fraction of the price, assuming they pass onsite inspection by a qualified technician.

5. Pushing of this list, to pre-qualified buyers, seeking pianos. This would augment the business of a technician or piano mover, intent on generating new opportunities for technical work or moving.

6. Expansion of options to include national search.

7. Expansion of options to choose additional sections for searching.

8. Combination with related scraping projects, such as:

   - promotion of music instruction

   - organizations in need of donated pianos

   - "make a wish" types of opportunities to provide a piano for a talented child in a low-income family

##Conclusion

Everyone ought to have some music (and some Ruby) in their life!

### Piano Student CMS - Sinatra Project

This application tracks the songlists for piano students. Students can sign up, select from existing repertoire, and add/remove songs from their songlist. When they add a new song, it becomes available to all students as an option to include in their respective songlists.

### VIDEO WALKTHROUGH

_Song_
has_many :students, through: :student_songs
has_many :student_songs

_Student_
has_many :songs, through: :student_songs
has_many :student_songs

_StudentSong_
belongs_to :student
belongs_to :song

### FUNCTIONALITY:

All students can view each other’s song lists, but only a logged in student can edit his/her own song list. Songlists, Students and Songs are all listed dynamically, alphabetically. LINKS to the various pages appear based on the functionality of a given page.

EXAMPLE: For example the home page, only shows these options:
welcome

EXAMPLE: Then, once logged in, these optionsi appear: Piano Students CMS App HOME _ SIGNUP _ LOGIN _ LOGOUT _ STUDENTS _ SONGS _ MY SONGS \_ EDIT MY SONGS
logged-in

Almost all of the pages have the following data, to help me track which/whether a user was logged in. Notice it change if you navigate to a fellow student's songlist. (this doesn't change the current_user though.)

logged-in

I made use of the “locals” message feature to display content based on whether a user is logged in or not. EXAMPLE on main index page: logged-in

If someone tries to hack the URL to see students data without logging in, they are redirected back to the home page to signup/login. However, a logged-in student could type in the URL and see other student’s song lists, (same as if they navigated there as part of the expected behavior of the app). Again, the logged-in student can view other student’s song lists, but cannot edit them.

Each song is hyperlinked to a page that shows a list of all students who have this song in their song list.

logged-in

Logout captures the exiting user in a variable to say a personal “goodbye” and keep practicing!

logged-in

### CHALLENGE: patch '/students/:id/songs'

patch

My biggest challenge was in updating the Student’s songlist.

I needed to be able to:

- Capture the list of songs the student checked.
- Compare that list with the student’s existing list, and add any that were new.
- Remove any that were now absent, based on the student’s checkbox choices.
- Add a new song if the student created one in the text box provided.

I had a challenge because I was scraping the existing StudentSongs table AFTER having added a new song fromt the text box. So when I finally did my scrape earlier, then added the new song, it worked.

I also struggled with setting up my form params in such a way as to make the update process work.

### RESTFUL-NESS

I tried to follow the REST patterns as well as I could. The code is probably ripe for refactoring as I currently tend to have to make 'cave man' code first before I can refine.

The attributes in the forms also are not second nature to me yet, although this video helped: http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ruby-006/sinatra-testing-nested-forms.mp4 This really helped me understand how I can control params at the form before they are posted.

I feel like more repetition will improve my speed, and although it is grueling to grind through the process, I can tell that I am internalizing the concepts.

There seems to be a balance needed between doing labs, experimenting on my own (to internalize), watching lecture videos (after my labs and experimentation), Googling problems and error messages, and reading Ruby books (again after labs & experimenting).

I realize that I will need to get more "legit" in terms of working with other developers, following conventions and getting code out the door within a reasonable time. The abiltiy to absorb new complexity and quantity of new concepts is a specific mind=muscle challenge. But, thankfully I find that I have the tenacity to keep at it until things work!

## Diet-Tracker

is a basic CMS (Content Management System) for Users to track their meals
and log their experiences while following a particular Diet.

This Rails application was developed as part of the Learn.co Full Stack Web Development course
If you are not familiar with [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/), please check it out!

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/v1492046956/diet-tracker/image001.png?raw=true)

## The major components are

Foods, Meals, Groups (food groups) , Diets and Users.

### Food

Food belongs to a specific Group (Dairy, Vegetables, Fruits, etc.).

Food has a default calories value of 1 upon creation, but can be
set to User\*s choice.

User can create a new Food and suggest Group, but Admin controls
editing of Foods/Groups.

Food _cals_ (calories) are tracked by User-meal, and by Group, so
we have stats on how many calories the Vegans are eating, how many meals, and
average calories per meal.

Same goes for Users, we track food calories, number of meals and
avg cals per meal.

### Group

Groups (food groups) are mostly categorical in this version.

Future versions could build views and stats on Groups, comparing
outcomes with User eating habits.

### Diet

Diets are tracked similar to Food calories, and a User can view
Diet Stats showing the stats for their diet aggregating all users on that Diet.

The Diet Stats can show how your (Diet) group\*s stats can suffer
if you fall off the wagon and eat 7 cheeseburgers while on the Vegetarian diet,
for example.

Only Admins can create new Diets.

### Meal

The heart of the app, is the new Meal(s) form, where a User can
input 3 meals for a day (breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner). Each meal is a
separate new instance of the Meal class, and requires a Date, Food and Qty,
note/memo is optional, all are captured using the custom attributes method _meals_attributes=_
in the User model.

Food can be selected (for each meal) via collection_select
(dropdown) menu, or the user can enter a new Food for that meal.

If a new Food, the entry is compared with the Database, to
find_or_create it, so there are not multiple matching foods.

Qty (quantity) is a number, that multiples whatever the calorie
(cals) amount is in the particular Food chosen. This product is added up with
other users on your same diet.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/v1492046956/diet-tracker/image002.png?raw=true)

### User (standard)

Registration

User can register via signup form, or use Omni-auth via Facebook.

Users can be either Standard or Admin (role), default is _standard_.

Only an Admin can access the form to edit a User*s *role\*, and
make them an Admin.

User functions

View

User can see all Foods, Groups, Diets and Diet Stats, but they
can\*t edit them.

(User can create new Foods via Meals nested form.)

Diet

Each User is on a single Diet at a time.

User can change Diet and is prompted to choose a Diet, if they
didn\*t choose during registration.

User can view DietStats, showing progress of all users on same
Diet.

Meals

See Meal above

Logs

User can create Log(s) with a date and a note, as much as they
want.

Log is nested under User, so only User and Admin can view a User\*s
logs.

Logs cannot be created for future date, must be today or earlier.

User Data

User can download their information from the User Account page,
in csv format.

## Example of User Account

page:

(Fred logs his struggle with cheeseburgers and cake)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/v1492046957/diet-tracker/image003.png?raw=true)

User (admin)

Admin has all functions of a standard user, in addition to Admin
functions.

Admin has full CRUD permissions for Foods, Groups, Diets and
Users

Admin logs in and has a pink _admin navigation bar_ for their functions

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/v1492046957/diet-tracker/image004.png?raw=true)

### Fun stuff

Celebrity Random Quotes on the home page

Home page shows random quote generator

User can generate 5 new random quotes with Celebrity, Verb,
Adjective, Food, Diet and Phrase. These are generated using

User can use a form to create new Verbs, Adjectives, Foods,
existing Diet and new Phrase.

New data is then incorporated into random quote generation.

User can download the current list of random quotes, via CSV
download link.

method that builds random quotes in quote.rb:

```ruby
  def self.build_random_quotes
    5.times do
      @quote = Quote.new
      @quote.celeb = Celeb.find(rand(1..Celeb.all.count.to_s.to_i))
      @quote.verb = Verb.find(rand(1..Verb.all.count.to_s.to_i))
      @quote.adj = Adj.find(rand(1..Adj.all.count.to_s.to_i))
      @quote.food = Food.find(rand(1..Food.all.count.to_s.to_i))
      @quote.phrase = Phrase.find(rand(1..Phrase.all.count.to_s.to_i))
      @quote.diet = Diet.find(rand(2..9))
      @quote.save
    end
  end
```

## Seeds.rb

Throughout this project I made heavy use of a seeds file, to
populate and re-populate my database with meaningful data.

rails db:drop

rails db:migrate

rails db:seed

Editing this file and catching errors as I constantly changed my
data model, helped me understand the application I was building from another
perspective.

It functioned as a good test of my application, to see if I had
broken things to where the data model might not consume the data properly.

Each model in the database has:

DATA hash

method to build the data using the attributes (columns) in
the data file

Having a familiar data set helps with troubleshooting forms,
views and envisioning the user experience interacting with the application.

DATA hash for adding users:

```ruby

DATA_users ={
 :user_keys =>
    ["role", "username", "email", "weight", "password", "diet_id"],
  :users => [
    [0, "ned", "ned@abc.com", 209, "pointer", 4],
    [1, "max", "max@abc.com", 190, "pointer", 2],
    [0, "skai", "skai@abc.com", 180, "pointer", 2],
    [0, "kaleo", "kaleo@abc.com", 203, "pointer", 3],
    [0, "megan", "megan@abc.com", 137, "pointer", 4],
    [0, "tenzing", "tenzing@abc.com", 120, "pointer", 5],
    [0, "davis", "davis@abc.com", 216, "pointer", 2],
    [0, "cole", "cole@abc.com", 255, "pointer", 3],
    [0, "ted", "ted@abc.com", 195, "pointer", 4],
    [0, "fred", "fred@abc.com", 320, "pointer", 1]
  ]
}
```

method for making the users from the DATA_users
hash

```ruby

def make_users
  DATA_users[:users].each do |user|
    new_user = User.new
    user.each_with_index do |attribute, i|
      new_user.send(DATA_users[:user_keys][i]+"=", attribute)
    end
    new_user.save
  end
end
```

The seeds file then calls a _master_ method (main) that simply
calls all the methods (one for each model), and data is loaded in the DB.

_master method_ that includes the _make_users_ method:

```ruby
def main
  make_diets
  make_groups
  make_foods
  make_users #order these methods by thinking through Active Record associations & models requiring foreign_keys
  make_logs  #that foreign_key must exist for the seed file to load
  make_mealnames
  make_meals
  make_celebs
  make_verbs
  make_adjs
  make_phrases
  make_quotes
end

main
```

## Lesson learned about the seeds.rb file:

If a model requires an ID from another model, you have to make
sure that the foreign key model is loaded first in order (top to bottom).

We can\*t make the Users until we have Diets, so that the User can
have a diet_id.

We can*t make Foods unless we*ve got Groups created first, because
a Food requires a group_id or it won\*t validate.

```ruby
class Food < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :meals
  belongs_to :group
  validates :name, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :cals, numericality: { greater_than: 0 }
end
```

## Requirements for this assignment:

### Full

requirements are
[here]("https://github.com/learn-co-students/rails-assessment-v-000/blob/master/README.md"),
stripped down version follows, with references to Diet-Tracker application
where requirement is met:

REQUIREMENTS

Use the Ruby on Rails framework.
Done

Your models must include a has_many, a belongs_to, and a has_many
:through relationship.
User has_many :meals, has_many :foods, through: :meals
User has_many :logs

Model acting as a join table for the has_many through.
Meal model, joins User and Food

The join model must also store an additional user submittable
attribute (not just timestamps or auto-created fields) describing the
relationship.
Meal form includes Food, either from existing, or User-submitted,
without creating duplicates.

Models should include reasonable validations for the simple
attributes.
All models have at least 1 validation, some have multiple
All new / edit forms for models have error handling in the forms.
Exception: the new Meal form because it uses nested attributes,
can only respond with _Meals is invalid_ because the errors do not flow up to
User in this case.
But, I do have flash message that shows on the form, if Meal is
invalid.
There are gems that I could pursue to make this work, but I chose
to leave this working as is.
Every other form in the app, lights up with big red errors if
data is invalid.

Include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope methods.
I have included 10, one for each Diet group of users.
Each scoped group is an alias of the Diet name, _Vegans_ _Carnivores_
_Vampires_, etc.
These scoped groups are then used to calculate DietStats.
The methods for this are all in the application_controller.

Include a nested form that writes to an associated model through
a custom attribute writer.
Meals/new form accepts 3 meals, using existing Foods or
User-submitted foods, processed by a _meals_attributes=_ method in User model.

This (custom attribute writer ) method cannot be provided via the
accepts*nested_attributes_for macro because the custom writer has to
\_find_or_create* with User submitted info.
See answer above. Done.

Application must provide a standard user authentication,
including signup, login, logout, and passwords.
Devise is used in this application for User sign_up, sign_in and
sign_out.

Authentication system allow 3rd party login. Facebook, twitter,
foursquare, github, etc...
OmniAuth is used for authentication via Facebook.

Nested resource with the appropriate RESTful URLs. Additionally,
your nested resource must provide a form that relates to the parent resource.
Logs is nested under User
Log new form, allows User to capture thoughts and experiences of
dieting.

Forms should correctly display validation errors. Your fields
should be enclosed within a fields_with_errors class and error messages
describing the validation failures must be present within the view.
Every other form in the app, lights up with big red errors if
data is invalid.
Exception: see new Meal form above

Application must be, within reason, a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself)
rails app. Logic present in your controllers should be encapsulated as methods
in your models. Your views should use helper methods and partials to be as
logic-less as possible. Follow patterns in the Rails Style Guide and the Ruby
Style Guide.
All models use partials for
new / edit form
model show view
model index view
Naming convention:

\_form is used for new/edit

\_model is used for show

\_models is used for index
Partials do not contain html formatting except for the use of
tables to display data
View do not call Models
Controllers are DRY according to my current level of
understanding and time constraints.

## Lessons Learned:

Take the time to write pseudo code, elaborate on visions before
proto-typing.

Don\*t get sucked into User Interface fun stuff at the expense of
core functionality and progress.

Think out loud through the process of an error. Something expects
something and isn*t getting it, for example. Get childlike simple about the
error message and you*ll likely discover that *something wants something but
isn*t getting it\*.

Think in sprints, don\*t just code like a squirrel here and there.
Decide what you're going to build today, write out some directions to yourself
and follow them.

#### Rails with jQuery Assessment

This post is an overview of the assignment to create a jQuery front end to an existing Rails app.

My choice was the Diet-Planner application, which tracks Users' Diets, Foods, Meals, Logs in a Rails app with a Postgresql backend, authorization via Devise and other goodies.
The app is currently [on Ubuntu 18.04 Digital Ocean here](https://diet-planner.smithwebtek.com)

#### Key Points

The app has the common functionality of index, show, edit, new, create, update, destroy for all models.
The data model is shown in this [ERD diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/v1494192278/diet-tracker/diet-planner-v8/erd.pdf)

#### The data model is summarized as follows:

Users register and track their Diets, Meals, Calories and Log their experiences
Users participate in groups of like-minded Dieters, to compare calories consumed, avg calories, etc.

Data model
Users
Foods
Groups
Diets
Meals
Quotes

#### Active Record relationships

User has_many :meals
belongs_to :diet

Meal belongs_to :user
belongs_to :food

Food belongs_to :group
has_many :meals

Group has_many :foods

Diet has_many :users

Log belongs_to :user
has_many :meals, through: :user

    Quote belongs_to :celeb(celebrity), :verb, :adjective, :food, :diet, :phrase

The "Quote" model is where most of the required jQuery / AJAX / JSON functionality is done.

#### Requirements

The following specs were requirements, and I'll go through each one with a few examples of meeting the requirement.

#### Use jQuery for implementing new requirements

    *The following files use jQuery:
    	add_celeb_food_diet_phrase.js
    	index_and_show.js
    	quotes.js

#### Include a show resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.

    *The following active model objects have data rendered for show view:
    *User

#### Include an index resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.

    *The following active model objects have data rendered for index views:
    *Users, Meals, Mealnames, Foods, Groups, Diets

#### Include at least one has_many relationship in information rendered via JSON and appended to the DOM.

    *The following active model object is rendered with JSON, showing has_many relationships:
    *Users
    	-has_many :meals, :foods, :logs
    *The Users index is rendered via jQuery / AJAX / JSON.
    *The data shown is then linkeable for individual User, also via jQuery/AJAX/JSON

#### Include at least one link that loads or updates a resource without reloading the page.

    *The following active model objects are loaded or updated without reloading page:
    *Users, Meals, Mealnames, Foods, Groups, Diets
    *Random JSON Quotes, Random HTML Quotes, New Quote, Clear Quotes
    *Create Celeb, Create Food, Create Diet, Create Phrase
    	-these items are saved to the database upon display, and available for inclusion in 'random quote generation'

#### Translate JSON responses into js model objects.

    *This is demonstrated with the 'New DropDown Quote' button and related code
    	-the form and resulting Quote, is shown via AJAX, and save to the database
    *New CelebMeal
    	-this is a JavaScript class CelebrityMeal, which is scripted within '/layouts/application.html.erb', because Heroku was not successfully finding the code.

#### At least one of the js model objects must have at least one method added by your code to the prototype.

    *this is demonstrated on the class CelebrityMeal, with a custom method 'customQuote', which creates another unique Quote based on the values submitted in the form, all via jQuery/AJAX/JSON

#### You have a large number of small Git commits

    *As of this writing, the repo has 125 commits directly related to this version of the app.

#### Your commit messages are meaningful

    *All of the commit messages are meaningful in terms of what was accomplished with that commit

#### You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message

    *While not 100%, the amount of changes related to commit messages is much higher than previous projects.
    *I still do have the tendency to jump around fixing things, vs staying focused on a single feature.

#### You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message

    *Not 100% here, but far better than in previous projects.

#### Code Example:

The following javascript file shows the current level of the programming.
Much of it is verbose, using low-level AJAX methods, with repetitive explicit naming of functions.
This is largely due to my newness at JavaScript, as well as the multiple moving pieces involved.
It does make the code more readable and understandable.

##### Essentially there are the following types of functions.

Functions that 'listen' for a particular element of the DOM (Document Object Model, or web page) to be clicked.
Sometimes, they trigger other functions, or retrieve a form form the server to be filled by the User, like this:
Example:

```javascript
function listenForNewQuote() {
  $('#new_quote_button').on('click', function (e) {
    e.stopImmediatePropagation()
    e.preventDefault()
    $.ajax({
      type: 'get',
      url: '/quotes/new'
    }).success(function (response) {
      clearResponseAreas()
      $('#response_area').html(response)
      newQuote()
    })
  })
}
```

Some functions watch 'buttons' or DOM elements, and when clicked, the 'listener' functions trigger internal server methods, such as this one which retrieves 5 'random quotes', by sending a 'GET' request to a specific route in the Rails application. That route, points to a Controller, which fires a method, to produce the 5 random quotes and send them back to the waiting AJAX function, for display in the DOM.

Example:

```javascript
function quotesJSON() {
  $('#random_json_quotes').on('click', function (e) {
    $.ajax({
      type: 'get',
      url: '/random_quotes',
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function (response) {
        clearResponseAreas()
        for (var i = response.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          $('#response_area').append(response[i] + '<br>')
        }
      }
    })
    e.stopImmediatePropagation()
    e.preventDefault()
  })
}
```

Some functions POST data to the server, mostly from forms filled by the User, to be saved to the database.
Example:

```javascript
function newQuote() {
  $('#response_area form').on('submit', function (e) {
    e.stopImmediatePropagation()
    e.preventDefault()
    $.ajax({
      type: 'post',
      url: '/quotes',
      data: {
        authenticity_token: $("input[name='authenticity_token']").val(),
        quote: {
          celeb: $('#quote_celeb').val(),
          verb: $('#quote_verb').val(),
          adj: $('#quote_adj').val(),
          food: $('#quote_food').val(),
          diet_id: $('#quote_diet_id').val(),
          phrase: $('#quote_phrase').val()
        }
      }
    }).success(function (response) {
      clearResponseAreas()
      $('#response_area').html(response)
    })
  })
}
```

Some functions trigger pre-planned Ruby methods, that produce data results, and display them.
There are a few in this application: 1. Random JSON Quotes 2. Random HTML Quotes 3. DropDown Quotes 4. User Generated Quotes 5. Class based Quote, using JavaScript Object Model and method that adds to its prototype
_ as opposed to writing out specific functionality in every script, the class object allows specific functionality to be added to the prototype (like a blueprint for an instance of the object).
_ the example here is a class CelebrityMeal, which takes items from the database to construct an instance of 'CelebrityMeal'. Then, because the class Celebrity Meal was written with a method CustomQuote, we can call the customQuote function on any instance of CelebrityMeal, to get the displayed results. \* this is demonstrated by clicking the button on home page: "New CelebMeal"

Some functions simply clear out data from the DOM, to keep the user experience as expected, for example:

Example:

```javascript
function clearResponseAreas() {
  $('#response_area').html('')
  $('#dropdown_quote_response_area').html('')
  $('#celeb_meal_response_area').html('')
}
```

#### Issues Overcome

I found the following challenges:
_ Difficulty managing various moving parts
_ Rails Routes, Controllers, Views, Models, Methods and ActiveRecord relationships - these are all the things the provide Rails goodness, and require complete refresh of the web page to view - as you add functionality to the JavaScript side of things, you have to keep abreast of how Rails routes, processes and returns things.
_ JavaScript: Having begun my programming with SQL Server, some HTML and some database scripting, I found Ruby to be a wonderful way to learn, because of its conversational nature. You can literally "talk" Ruby code as you reason through how things function. Add to that the Rails conventions and you begin to absorb the language intuitively. Your eyes and instincts begin to guide you through coding and troubleshooting. Sometimes you just get a hunch that a certain thing will work and it does; other times you sense a dead end and refactor.
_ With JavaScript I do believe that intuition will come, but for me a little longer.

- However, my mileage may vary as this was my experience learning a 2nd programming language after immersion in the first. I think that the common threads of programming vernacular will start to guide me through new languages and that the learning curve will be easier than the first few.
  \*Debugging JavaScript, Ajax, JSON within the Rails ecosystem can be complicated. But once you get through a few examples of the full data life cycle through js functions, in and back from Rails, navigating the DOM and keeping track of "THIS" as it changes state, there does seem to be a finite number of issues that are usually the culprit. My style is based on being a craftsman all of my life, so we learn by doing something many times. Brute will power and tenacity go a long way.

#### What I Found

    * I found that sometimes it was not clear why certain JavaScript functionality was breaking, or not refreshing, or just laying there on the page unflinching when I expected it to clear, or update.

    * I found that if you type out your next few moves, deciding what you want in functionality, things go better. Write psuedo code, simply dreaming out loud as to what you want the code to do; then bite off a small chunk to make it 'real' with simple working code.

    * I found that you are much better off doing multiple commits to github, organizing your work so that your comment doesn't need to be huge, because you are making commits often enough.

    	1. Decide what you want to code
    	2. Write down pseudo code explanation, organizing statements into somewhat defined actions
    	3. Bite off an easy part, make data appear somewhere, get a view to work, get a method to return something.
    	4. Hook one thing to another thing, simply displaying an intentional piece of code/data.
    	5. Take the time to name things consistently
    		- use instinctive names, brief but descriptive
    		- if you make several of things of similar type, be on the look out for tidy naming conventions
    		- verbose, working, consistently named code...may not be sexy, but other experienced coders will appreciate that they can 'get' what you wrote quicker, so they can help you improve.
    		- verbose, working, consistently named code...gives the rest of the world something tangible to work with, making YOU more 'workable with'

    * I found that you can make an entire Rails application DANCE BABY!, without leaving the home page.

#### Summary

I'm looking forward to more with JavaScript, having just scratched the surface with this application.
I see now why there are so many JavaScript frameworks out there, because of where it fits in web development, and the fact that you can slip it in anywhere. Rails conventions have made it far more scalable than if it was left to 'grow your own', same goes for JavaScript, so I'm looking forward to delving into React next.

### This post summarizes the final project I built to meet the graduation requirements for the Flatiron School (Learn Verified) Full Stack Web Developer program.

All of the requirements are met and then some.
I took this project seriously and have done the best I can given my current skills.

### REQUIREMENTS

[X] The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
[X] Uscreate-react-app generator to start your projec
[X] Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
[X] Tere should be 2 container components
Selected list of CONTAINERS: Lessons, Students, Teachers, Resources, LessonResources (and there are more )
[X] here should be 5 stateless components
Selected list of STATELESS FUNCTIONAL components: Student, Teacher, Resource, StudentService, TeacherService, ResourceService, LessonService ( among others )
[X] There should be 3 routes

List of routes:
/students, /teachers, /resources, /lessons (for indexs of these data groups)
/students/:id (for individual student)
/students/:id/edit (for editing individual studen
/teachers/:id (for individual teacher)
/teachers/:id/edit (for editing individual teacher)
/resources/:id (for individual resource)
/resources/:i/editd (forediting individual resource)

      /lessons/:id (for individual lesson)
      /lessons/:id /edit(for iediting ndividual lesson)

[X] use react-router and proper RESTful routing
[X] use async actions to send data to and receive data from a server
[X] Rails API should handle the data persistence.
[X] You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and [] POST data from your API
[X] Do not use jQuery methods.
[X] client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
[X] app should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap),
[X] write (additional) CSS yourself if you wish
[X] use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change

### Concept for the app

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/v1516500349/music-student_pnmwbr.png?raw=true)
The idea was to create a music studio CRM and teaching tool, incorporating Students, Teachers, Resources and Lessons
Teachers can quickly add/remove Resource(s) to a Lesson, all interlinked and defined for the Student (and Teacher)
3 types of Resources are instantly rendered in a custom Resource Viewer accessible to Teacher and Student.
TheResource Viewer uses stateless function components for each of the 3 Resource types 'pdf'=PDF, 'aud'=Audio, 'vid'=Video
Rals API and Active Record provide data persistence, semantic layer and JSON data via the browser
ActiveRecord associations and Rails Serializers provide complex and solid interleaving of data, at API endpoints
React provides the framework to allow Javascript to play nicely with HTML and CSS
Redux provides the management of the "state" of the data, as it comes and goes to the database via the API

### Regarding "state"...

I chose to mix both Redux state and "local" state in some components.
I learned it through research and I found that there are some things that do not need to be in the Redux state, such as:

    - the temporary data someone types into a form before saving

    - the visibility status of a modal or presentational component

    - data that is massaged, grouped or staged prior to assembly before going to the database

### Regarding CSS...

I used 3 different methods for styling. - ReactStrap was helpful in providing a quick method to get components and data rendered in a decent view - CSS modules and the approach of creating dedicated CSS files matching files and folders of the project, made it easy to add custom CSS when I where I needed it, without having to build it all from scratch. There are timeswhen I absolutely
insist on tweaking something visual. And there are times when I just want to throw in a component and have it work, while I grapple with some deeper thought and programming - Inline styles. God forbid, yes there are some places where I just wanted some quick styling without creating a css file, and without importing a reactstrap component.

### # Example of custom styles for buttons DELETE, EDIT, SAVE:

```css
.ResourcesList {
  color: black;
  width: 100%;
}

.Form {
  float: left;
  text-align: left;
  padding: 15px;
  width: 60%;
  height: 100%;
  color: rgb(75, 67, 67);
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}

.Danger:hover {
  background-color: rgb(238, 84, 84);
}

.Edit:hover {
  background-color: rgb(250, 233, 77);
}

.Success:hover {
  background-color: rgb(92, 243, 150);
}

.FormInstructions {
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: 600;
}

.Disabled {
  background-color: #c7c6c6;
  cursor: not-allowed;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  color: #888888;
}

th {
  width: 3%;
}

td {
  width: 10%;
}
```

### Regarding React

I hated it! Until I learned it. Now I really enjoy it.
I am happy to have found a place to use Rails as an API while using React and Redux to make the single page client side rock!

I have not learned Angular or VUEjs, but I can tell they are in my future. I am so excited at the idea of being able toput my creative ideas into practice through coding!

### Building Rails API

DATA MODEL, migrations, active record relationships and sample data:

### # #TEACHER

attributes :id, :firstname, :lastname, :email
has_many student has_many :lessons
has_many :lesson_resources, through: :lessons
has_many :resources, through: :lessons

### # STUDENT

attributes :id, :firstname, :lastname, :email, :level, :teacher_id
belongs_to :teac
has_many :lessons
has_many :resources, through: :lessons

### # LESSON

attributes :id, :date, :notes, :teacher_id, :student_id, :student, :teacher
belongs_to :teacher
belongs_to :student
has_many :lesson_resources
has_many :resources, through: :lesson_resources

### # LESSON_RESOURCE

attributes :id, :lesson_id, :resource_id
belongs_to :lesson
belongs_to :resource

```sql
  create_table "lesson_resources", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.integer "resource_id"
    t.integer "lesson_id"
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
  end

  create_table "lessons", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.date "date"
    t.string "notes"
    t.integer "teacher_id"
    t.integer "student_id"
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
  end

  create_table "resources", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "title"
    t.string "category"
    t.string "description"
    t.string "format"
    t.string "location"
    t.string "url", default: "no_url_given"
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
  end

  create_table "students", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "firstname"
    t.string "lastname"
    t.string "email"
    t.integer "level"
    t.integer "teacher_id"
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
```

### # User Experience

**Teacher** has the ability to organize, view, create and assign multiple **Resource(s)** to **Student** via **Lesson**, from a central repository of **Resources**.

Resources stored online based on Resource type

    Audio: Soundcloud

    PDF: Cloudinary

    Image: Cloudinary

    Video: YouTube

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import Pdf from './Pdf'
import Vid from './Vid'
import Aud from './Aud'
import Aux from '../../../hoc/Aux/Aux'
import Spinner from '../../../UI/Spinner/Spinner'
import styles from './ResourceViewer.css'

const ResourceViewer = props => {
  let renderResource = (
    <div className={styles.Center}>
      <Spinner />
      <p>This resource has not been created yet. </p>
    </div>
  )

  if (
    props.resource.format === 'pdf' &&
    props.resource.url !== 'no_url_given'
  ) {
    renderResource = <Pdf url={props.resource.url} />
  }

  if (
    props.resource.format === 'vid' &&
    props.resource.url !== 'no_url_given'
  ) {
    renderResource = <Vid url={props.resource.url} />
  }

  if (
    props.resource.format === 'aud' &&
    props.resource.url !== 'no_url_given'
  ) {
    renderResource = (
      <Aux>
        <hr />
        <h4>{props.resource.title}</h4>
        <Aud resource={props.resource} />
      </Aux>
    )
  }

  return <div>{renderResource}</div>
}

export default ResourceViewer
```

Easy access to multiple resources while teaching.
Add / remove resources to lessons

**Students** have real-time list of all assigned **Resources**
**Teachers** see all of their **Student(s)**, **Lesson(s)** and all available **Resource(s)**
**Lesson** can have multiple **Resources**, easy add / remove
All data is inter-related through Active Record, surfaced by Rails API and Rails Serializers
Add and Edit forms, are using Modals to enhance User Experience

### # Building basic React app

### # #Folder Structure

React Container / Component folder structure for the main 4 data groups is consistently named and organized.
Each of the 4 groups has unique requirements for data and inter-relations with the other groups.
Naming conventions for folders and javascript files follow Rails restful perspective.
User Interface components are in a separate folder for reuse by any of the main component groups.

### # #Style and Responsiveness

Styling is minimal, but clean through use of Reactstrap
Beyond Reactstrap there are several customized css files, each paired and named the same as the files they serve.
There are some global css styles in App.css, imported as "appstyles".
The layout is responsive, with the main menu collapsing into the 'hamburger' icon.

### # Redux:

All 4 major data groups have idential Redux actions, reducers and naming conventions
As a result, it was easy to add a 5th major data group "LessonResources" which allowed the convenient feature of adding and
removing Resources to a given Lesson.

### # #Middleware

Thunk (middleware) is implemented to allow each of the 4 main data groups to have Start, Success, Fail phases for all CRUD
operations with the AP

### # Rails API serves all data requirements for Index, Show, Create, Update, Destroy and all possible groupings availabe through

ActiveRecord associations.
Serializers are used extensively to serve API data without any need for manipulation on the client side.
In fact, one could surf all of the various data groups throught the JSON API available in the browser.

### # The concept of the site is to bring as many varied resources to bear on the student as possible, all formats.

PDF files showing musical notation and ideas are easily accessible through the ResourceViewer component which serves up stateless functional components based on Audio, Video, PDF formats (format field in Resource database table).
The ResourcesList has functionality to show whether a Resource has a URL or not, disabling the SHOW button if so, based on the value in the URL field.
Resources can therefore be added quickly, even if they don't have URL information.

```javascript
{
  resource.url === 'no_url_given' ? (
    <td>
      <button type='button' className='Disabled'>
        empty
      </button>
    </td>
  ) : (
    <td>
      <button>
        <Link
          to={`/resources/${resource.id}`}
          params={{ id: resource.id }}
          key={resource.id}
          onClick={props.close}
        >
          show
        </Link>
      </button>
    </td>
  )
}
```

### # Data:

A custom rake file was used throughout development to allow convenient data replenishin
the command is **rake db:dcms**

### # #Drop, Create, Migrate, Seed / Start

This allows for confidence in data integrity while in the throes of development and debugging.
The seed data is realistic and provides another layer of confidence during development.

### # Cloudinary: https://cloudinary.com

Cloudinary is an excellent platform for storage and retrieval of digital artifacts, delivered to the site quickly like a CDN.
Their API provides extensive manipulation of files for integration into the site, although for this project it was only used
as means of storage and quick retrieval through custom URL's which currently hardcode in the seeds data file.
Future versions of this app would allow automatic storage, manipulation and retreival of digital files, as an added
convenience for Teachers and Students.

### # Mockaroo: https://www.mockaroo.com

Mockaroo is a site where you can spin up dummy data quickly in formats that make sense with your application, and then
available for quick download in many formats.

### # Seeds.rb:

The seeds file for this project is based on a structure in one of the Learn curriculum labs, which I expanded upon to suit the needs for this project. My strong belief is that without seed data, and a solid data model, it is akin to building on sand versus a strong data foundation.
Care was also taken in the choosing of names for data, folders and files, adhering to RESTful conventions as much as
possible. Data names also are as organic as possible reflecting their day to day usage.

### # Future:

I would like to explore the use of **MIDI** information in a 'play along' format for piano students. After nearly 2 years of hundreds of programming labs, where tests light up GREEN or RED, I believe it can be done in a similar fashion for piano students. The goal would be to capture the digital markers for a song, to use as a test measure.
The student would then play their MIDI based keyboard along with the recorded sample track, while javasript functionality compares the student performance against the recorded sample (of course, alowing for human error, enough to encourage accuracy without bogging the student down in tedious musical theory early in their development.

### # Observations on the Flatiron journey:

I believe that much of software programming comes down to conceptualizing what needs to happen and then finding the language and syntax to bring it into physical reality. Debugging a difficult error always follows a pattern of mystery, clues, thought, experimentation and solution.

People tend to bring their own personalities into whatever they do. Programming is no different. One has to confront their own emotions, personal inertia and adapt to the requirements of learning new languages. I have found that I work best coding along with superior programmers, followed by my own experimentation and brute force repetition of concepts until I have internalized them. My reading of material has improved greatly as a result of the Flatiron curriculum, because one is forced to think through problems, research / trial & error to solve labs.

My own history as a craftsperson pushes me to build projects and refine code instinctively. There is such a satisfaction in seeing code work in the browser especially when it does what you expected it to do!

I've learned to be more patient with things I don't know, errors I don't understand and more patient with myself when I go completely blank momentarily forgetting basic things.

The daily/weekly onslaught of constantly learning new languaes, syntax, configuration and idiosyncracies of every language gradually builds an internal mental toughness to absorb new things through all senses, not just the eyes and brain.

## THE LIST

This is my current list, as it came stream of consciousness.
Your mission: get inspired by one or more of these ideas, and implement it if you want to.

This is a list of things I wish I had done in my first 2 years as a developer and student of development. While I did do several of these, I did not do ALL of them as EARLY as I could, or as FREQUENTLY as I wish, or as CONSISTENTLY as I would have preferred. Think of this article as your 'future self' talking to you and giving you advice that you should take to heart now.

_WARNING_
These are all common sense habits, but they do not have the urgency that matches their importance over the long term.
You will never see these habits as urgently as a ringing phone, or alarm.
But they are worth doing, even if your "progress" slows a bit, in terms of speeding through the curriculum.
Habits can be formed in 30 days.
You'll start out having to prioritize things that don't seem as important as cranking through labs.
It will seem like you are wasting time.

### 1. MAKE LITTE GREEN BOXES ON GITHUB, every day

No matter how good looking you are, or how good your resume is, or how much your cool site talks about how you save the world, or how many people think you are fun to hang with, or how many people at meetups recognize your face, or how many emails you send to potential jobs.....(...add more if you like)

#### Making little green boxes on GitHub:

... will show that you are consistently practicing your craft
... will help mitigate the fact that you don't have years of experience to reference.
... will demonstrate that you can be useful to an enterprise.

#### A professional musician practices or makes music every day.

Developers code every day. And you have no idea how much you are actually learning, especially if you stop for awhile and come back to find your mind is blank. Don't worry, it is accumulating in there, but set the odds in your favor.

## You want a green grid like this:

# BOXES! Green... every day

### 2. Document your projects

You will forget how you created some things. You will actually temporarily forget how you coded some things and you will marvel that the code you pushed up, is actually yours. It doesn't have to be a ton of info, but at least capture the little tidbits about configuration, or how a Gem behaves, or error messages you battled. Help the Universe by capturing this stuff, and it will also become great blog meat (yes, I said it: "blog meat"). So, write little summaries of your projects, start with editing README files.

### 3. Create your own glossary or bookmarks folder to capture the deluge of information for now and future

I have a huge list of bookmarks. It is not highly organized but at least I have a way to quickly capture ideas that I encounter, and I try to put them in folders where I can find them in the future. I will be turning a portion of my site into a curation / library / wiki of all the stuff I've collected. I got this idea from a great teacher who encouraged the building of your own glossary from day one.

In my case, I am building a little factory like this:

1. Bookmark
2. Do "hello world" example of it
3. Do an actual project with it
4. Outline it for a blog post, including
   -Title
   -Summary
   -Major points
   -Examples
   -Main Point
   -Conclusion

### 3a: Blog with a modular app built like the "bookmark-helloWorld-project-blog" machine

Create an app with a data model that represents the parts of a blog.
Start filling in the buckets as you encounter juicy subjects.
It does not have to be complex, but why not use our knowledge of Sinatra and Rails to create modular blog material?
My current blog data model is as follows:

```ruby
 create_table "posts", force: :cascade do |t|
  t.date     "date"
  t.string   "title"
  t.string   "repo",       default: "enter_full_URL_or_leave_blank"
  t.string   "video_url"
  t.string   "site_url"
  t.text     "summary",    default: "summary_blank"
  t.text     "content_md",    default: "blank_md"
  t.text     "content_html",    default: "blank_html"
  t.datetime "created_at",                                           null: false
  t.datetime "updated_at",                                           null: false
end
```

### 3b: Blog in your favorite text editor with Markdown syntax

As you can tell, I am a little clumsy with this right now, because I can't format things as pretty in VSCODE as I can in a Word doc. But the benefit is that I am living and working in my coding environment, using all the cool keyboard short cuts I know to get around, while I blog, while I improve my blog site, which is a Rails app, which I've published on Heroku with my own domain name. So I'm using 'gravity' to my advantage, not straying far from the tools of my trade. And USING the tools of my trade in my every day life as much as possible.

It's like remembering to bring something when you leave the house. You put it in a shopping back and hang it on the door knob, so you know you'll run into it when you leave. If I'm constantly coding, blogging, developing with the tools I use as a professional developer, I'm putting "mundane" tasks to use constantly improving my skills.
So the command line becomes second nature.
Repos, git commands, commits, branches, become second nature.
And, the more this happens, the less interference between inspiration to working code.

#### Use the gem 'rails-erd' to create an (ERD) Entity Relationship Diagram of your data model:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/c_scale,w_347/v1516678229/blog-data-model_rxdqj1.png)

#### 4. Take 5-10 seconds to read your code again ...just before you run a test

Form your own expectation of the results before you run a test.
Form an opinion first, it creates a 'teaching moment'.

Observe some things about this:

1.  You lose less mental energy when you have reached some kind of conclusion about what should happen, even when incorrect. I love it when I take the time to proofread after several edits, and I think through each line, catching typos. It helps me stay "proactive" or "active" towards my effort, and less like a victim struggling through a dense forest. I think we don't stop enough and get our own mind thinking through what the code is doing. Forcing yourself to write code from only your memory is also a way to jumpstart your mind. It is worth it to test yourself and see how much you can actually produce on your own, through logic and deduction.

    2. If it fails, you are in a better position to have another, more refined opinion, and probably one that is closer to the solution, better than if you simply threw something against the wall to see if it would stick. The more you can develop this thoughtful approach, the more you will learn, from both code that works and code that blows up.

    3. If you can develop the patience to read, form an opinion and actually read the error...
       ....you will be closer to confronting the root cause, sooner.
       (software and computers, as designed, are perfect)
       (almost 100% of the time, there is a completely valid reason why something is not happening as you expect)
       (I find this very comforting, to remove the emotion, side-step the frustration and see it as a machine.)

    4. Most applications have a few processes to trace...(not hundreds).
       for example:
       -The data usually starts somewhere, moves somewhere, is transformed somehow, rendered somewhere and eventually returned somewhere

       -Variables are usually declared, are of a certain type, are populated somehow, get used somewhere, and are "in scope" at some point, and "out of scope" at another point.

       -Configuration can be tricky, especially with things that are new or with highly evolving documentaion.
       But even then, there IS a way that configuration works, and we just have to find it.
       Again, having an opinion, logically reached, helps us find our way through it.

#### The opposite is what I call "squirrel coding"

The squirrel is not that smart, just because he picked away at the garbage can until the lid happened to fall off, doesn't mean he actually knows how to open the can. We don't want to have to code like a squirrel "trying whatever" until we swerve into the solution. God forbid the test passes and you don't know why!

Start with the small, simple, basic "hello world" level of something new and difficult.
Say to yourself what you expect it do to.
Read your code over again before compiling, running, executing, etc.
Try to catch errors in your thoughts before you just hit the button and try it.
Get to the point where you really expect your code to work before you test.

### 5. Code along with videos

But keep your head in the game by actually typing everything, don't get passive.
Code along with everything the presenter is doing, but as soon as you have a sense of what they'll code next, STOP the video and see how far you can get on your own. Then when you resume play, the video will mean far more.
This requires a personal motivation / fire in the belly, which will reap big rewards.

### 6. Create your own folder system

    Store experimental code and labs in sections and categories that make sense to you.
    Own this material, by filing it away on your system, so you can retreive it.
    As you visit or revisit a topic, create little summaries that could be the seeds of a blog post.
    I think we should blog not just for publishing to the world, but simply to organize our own heads.

### 7. Create your own naming conventions, or adopt some and use them.

This promotes consistency in your thinking and code.
And it forms habits that will serve you in the future when you have to regenerate your brain.
These are all byproducts of 'owning' the learning process.

Meaningful names last longer in a project, it is worth the time to create good names.
You will be typing these names hundreds of times while you code, so the more they are organic, short, easy to spell and easy to PLURALIZE, the better.

### 8. Reach out and talk to other people

You have no idea how powerful it is to have your burden shared even for a moment with other like minded souls. This is one of the valuable parts of Flatiron, setting it apart from the other schools. My personal belief is that it began with Avi Flombaum's spirit of teaching, heart for coding and raw talent. I am so grateful he decided to do a school instead of a million other things he could have done with the last 5 years. And, I believe that he inherited some of this attitude from [Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto), "Matz is nice, so we are nice".

### 9. Help someone else every day

Helping other people is actually very helpful to oneself. Most of the time, it is not technical in nature. You don't have to be an expert, to ask simple questions about clarifying code. You might just help the other person jog their memory as they explain the problem. [Be a duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
I think that at least half of it is that you are bearing their burden with them even if for a brief time. As a result that they are strengthened enough to keep moving. Build up their strength so they can start forming their own opinions, starting from something verifiably true, testing and forming another opinion.

### 10. Ask people (end users, civilians) what they wish their software could do

Ultimately we are about making the world a better place, through our talents as developers. Who better to ask than people around us who are frustrated with how their software meets their needs.

[this article and podcast](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/podcasts/no-ideas-no-expertise-no-money-business/) captures this idea very well.

_funny story that happened recently:_

I was at a meetup recently where a group of developers had a long discussion about what kind of app we could produce as a volunteer group for our community. The conversation wandered and settled on the loudest person in the room (where most devs are a little shy, the loudest voice takes on more meaning than it sometimes deserves). The consensus for an app became focused on this person's opinion that we needed an app to track "pot holes" in the street and possibly a feature to track whether someone had left dog droppings without cleaning it up. ( we'll pause while I give a sigh... )

Now, we live in a city where there are about 50 drug overdose deaths monthly. As I listened, it occured to me that we should ask the local police, fire, hospital, EMT workers if there was some way we could help them by developing an application. Perhaps I was not loud enough about this idea, but it did seem to register with many of the other attendees. My point: ASK USERS WHAT THEY NEED, instead of living in your own head when imagining what the app should do. Focus on the problems of your users, instead of broadcasting your features! Features are only useful if a user has a problem first, that is solved by that feature.

### Problem Knowledge vs Product Knowledge

In any development effort, you are faced with a long list of "nice to haves", "wish lists", etc. As I used to say to sales people: STOP broadcasting your product knowledge. Your awareness of the client's PROBLEM is far more important than any PRODUCT knowledge you have of features and benefits.

Users do not care that you have a thousand ways to code something. They have a limited budget, time and attention span to determine if you can actually solve their problem or not, before they move on to find the person who actually does understand their problem. This applies whether you are in a cutting edge startup, working for the most mundane of governmental departments or having a meeting with the local girl scouts to plan their site.

But then maybe people do want a "dog poo app", as was suggested in the meetup earlier.

_...and we're moving on_

## 12. DO QUANTITY as well as quality

I find with music students and students of piano tuning, that sometimes they just need to DO MORE. Repetition of skills to the point where they become deeper in your mind ( and deeper into your hands physically ) produces higher levels of everything. With piano, you practice things physically until your body becomes a conduit for musical ideas and emotions. You practice the language parts (scales, melodies, chord harmony positions) until you think on a higher plane about all of it.

My first piano tuning took me 6 hours of intense work, after 6 months of practice 4-6 hours per day to get to that point. My mentor told me that I could not charge for my service until I could tune a whole piano in 2hours, and until I had tuned 1000 pianos at the music school first.

My sense is that we'll all have this kind of trajectory in our growth as developers. I have built over 25 working Rails applications and about 20 working React apps. I've scratched the surface, but even in this effort I can start to think about Rails application possibilities on a higher level than I did when I was just learning to cobble things together and stumbling over every form, method, partial, route and configuration.

As a consultant in the past, I worked with different organizations on issues they had with sales, delivery and project management. I found that most sales people had one of three problems: 1. Not talking to the right people 2. Talking to the right people, but not saying the right things. 3. Talking to the right people, saying the right things, but not talking to ENOUGH right people.

So, the point.... do more, code more, there are huge benefits from producing not only quality, but QUANTITY.  
 And, on that same point...
When you do a project, do 3 or 4 very similar object types for your data, which will force some repetition in to your project build, simply because you have multiple data groups to deal with. For example, my last project (a music teaching studio app), had Students, Teachers, Resources and Lessons. This forced me to repeat a lot of code that was very similar for the four data groupings, further deepening my understanding of the code involved.

Had I only scraped my way through one data grouping, I would not have had nearly as rich a learning experience.

### 13. Make your own list like this

Everyone has insights along these lines. Make your own list and let us all read your blog so we can adopt some of your ideas too!

Columbo (the great 70s TV detective) would often solve a case with small bits of seemingly unimportant information. The unwitting suspect would admit to key points while Columbo quietly built his case. This post covers some points that may seem unimportant compared to coding your solution, but if done, will "build your case" for a solid dataset and foundation for your development project.

For applications that require a database, there are steps I follow that help me ensure my data is solid before I write any of the application logic or client side views. Like Columbo, this helps me eliminate things that would otherwise clutter my thinking as I develop, debug and add abstraction to my application.

If your project requires a database, take the time to plan it out, considering the table relationships, the column names, meaningful seed data and a reusable script of steps for resetting your data while working locally on your machine, or publishing on a remote server.

## Some reasons why I always do this before a project:

I want to have a bullet proof way to reset my database anytime I please, with minimal refactoring or wondering, especially when I end up deploy my apps to Heroku, Netlify, Firebase, AWS or Github pages, I want to be sure that I have solid code for resetting my data on a remote server. With a thoughtful seed file, I have an easy way to add both new fields to my database and add new data to match those fields, removing any guesswork about the effectiveness of the new data.

The idea is to have solid relational data prepared before you begin the thornier parts of client side development. If you are building anything from a small app, to a full blown API serving up data to a front end app, these steps will help you to:

1. Conveniently Drop, Create, Migrate, Seed and Start your database and application
2. Keep your focus during development
3. Eliminate some complexities during debugging, because you can rule out data problems
4. Have a familiar dataset throughout development, so that:
   a. Your views are more meaningful
   b. You will gain insights on ways to enhance your data model, based on your development
   c. You will have a convenient way to add these enhancements, and painlessly bring your results to life.

When we are in the throes of debugging and trying to make our code work, a great helper can be your seed dataset. You know exactly what the list of 'cats' or 'books' should be and sometimes you don't get 100% clear answers from the developer console or debugger(s).

## Summary of steps:

1. Plan Data Model
2. Choose Naming Convention
3. Plan Active Record relationships
4. Write Database Migrations
5. Use Active Model Serializer gem
6. Create Seed file and Test
7. Create Rake tasks to DCMS (Drop, Create, Migrate, Seed / Start) the DB and App

## Why?

The better you can shape your tables around actual user needs, the more relevant your applications will be. Ask enough questions to determine relationships of one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many

Most important, you want to think about the relationships between tables, so that you get the complex relationships you need, while you leave simple things alone.

Solid data models are a combination of:

- practical thinking about how you refer to the data
- intuitive naming conventions
- database relationships

### Practical Thinking:

Your early instincts about names often prove correct.
If you find yourself calling a table something other than what you've named it, you probably should consider changing to your instinctive names. Be aware that there are ['reserved words'](http://www.rubymagic.org/posts/ruby-and-rails-reserved-words) in most languages. You don't want to use 'type' for a table name in Rails for example.

### Naming Conventions:

You want to develop your instincts for tight, short names if possible, that reflect the intuitive understanding of your data. You'll type these names hundreds of times in the development of your project, so wouldn't you rather type "zip" instead "postal_code"?

### Talk about your data, using Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives

What is it?
What does it do?
Why does it do it?
When does it do it?
When does it start doing that?
When does it end doing that?
What changes after that?
Where does it exist?
What things does it touch ?
How many are there of it?
How is it created, edited, updated, deleted?

### Identify NOUNs

- Student, Teacher, Post, Task

What are the attributes (ADJECTIVES) of that NOUN?

- student.age, student.major
- teacher.tenure_status, teacher.specialty
- post.title, post.content
- task.title, task.date

What are the VERBS describing things you do with that NOUN?

- student: 'attends' a class, 'submits homework', 'asks a question'
- teacher 'teaches a class', 'grades homework', 'creates lesson plan'
- post: 'is read by a user', 'is liked or disliked', 'is published'
- task: 'is created', 'is overdue', 'is completed'

List the ways the NOUNs relate to each other:

- Teacher 'has_many' Student(s)
- Teacher 'has_many' classes
- Student has one Teacher for one class
- Student 'has_many' Teachers, through classes
- Post 'belongs_to' Author
- Author 'has_many' Post(s)
- Task 'belongs_to' Student

List specific relationships that will require a JOIN table

- You might have a Class table, that 'has_many' Students, and 'belongs_to' a single Teacher
- This would allow a singe Teacher to 'has_many' Students, THROUGH a Class
- The Class table might have these basic fields:

  - id (class_id if referred to in other tables)
  - teacher_id (the ID of a Teacher)
  - student_id (the ID of a Student)
  - subject (the subject of the class for example)

- We would create a new row in the Class table, for every single student_id
- This allows us to query the database for a single Teacher and get all the students for that Teacher through the rows in the Class table that contain that particular teacher's ID (teacher_id).

### For Example

In a recent Rails app for a music teaching studio, I wanted to have tables for Teachers, Students, Resources and Lessons. I talked through each one in my mind, determining the following for my context:

```ruby
Teacher
- has_many :students
- has_many :lessons
- has_many :resources, through: :lessons

Student
belongs_to :teacher
- has_many :lessons
- has_many :resources, through: :lessons

Lesson
belongs_to :teacher
belongs_to :student
- has_many :resources

Resource
- has_many :lessons
- has_many :teachers, through: :lessons
- has_many :students, through: :lessons
```

Wherever possible, I wanted to exploit Active Record relationships so that my API data would have not only the related ID's but full related objects.

## Takeaways

### Nouns and Verbs

- think about Nouns and Verbs as you imagine your data set,
- often a single (1) Noun takes action (verb) on (many) of another Noun
- who has many of what?
- what belongs to a single who?
- what are the natural join tables ( a Class joins a Teacher with multiple Students)
- what join tables do you need to create?

### You might have to literally join two tables with an obvious name such as:

- project_student
- so a Teacher might 'has_many' project_students
- ...and would therefore 'has_many' students THROUGH project_students
- this would differentiate between the students that the Teacher has via Class, as above

### Settle on the types of table relationships you need

- 1 to 1
- 1 to many
- many to many
- stand alone

## CREATE YOUR DATA PLAN

- Based on your research, plan out your tables, columns and relationships
- This is one of the most productive things you can do before you start coding
- A solid plan, documented, provides you a path for inevitable future changes/iterations
- This forces you to refine your naming conventions

## Speaking of naming conventions...

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTot9BkPEzMHbP4uWvww0QMhOYhDbT_Pa224lyDMJr7ZpJk7Bb0)

### Here are some thoughs about naming tables and columns.

- I like easy names to spell and type, since we're typing them hundreds of times while we code. And we're thinking through code with these names in our head, so you want as little interuption in thought (over mundane things you can control) as possible.

- I like all lower case names if they work within best practices for the context.

  - fname is a little cryptic, a little less readable than firstname
  - firstName is fine, if you never screw up the camel casing

  - firstname is easier becuase you never have to add a though about a capital.
    It is also only 3 letters different than 'lastname', so you can quickly copy it and edit the copy

- Short, concise names keep your thoughts clear, and lower case reduces typos
  your mileage may vary and your boss may differ; don't be stubborn if your context requires something specific

- Your ability to FOLLOW what is asked of you, exactly, shows an employer that you can be a proper part of the business machinery; that you can be relied upon to do what is needed, without argument or improvisation where improvisation is not wanted or useful to the goal

## Summary

We need to think through our data, to choose practical, organic relationships.
We want to avoid too many fields for now, but still create enough data interconnection to make our API rich with relational data.

---

## Migrations and Seed file

We covered the internal thinking you must do before coding your Rails application data model. That internal work will save you a lot of rewriting, if you have asked yourself enough questions about the interactions of your tables and the naming conventions you will type 100s of times during your development process.

Have you ever been on a project where you are constantly using the word "title" in your code, but instead the database requires the word "name"? Or my favorite peeve: firstName vs first_name vs fname vs first-name.

It is important to refine WHAT YOU WANT, before you start coding it.
Pseudo coding the database relationships, table names, column names and even the actual Rails database migrations, will:

1. Make your project flow smoothly from conception to reality
2. Provide you with convenient paths to follow for changes
3. Document the database for working with other developers
4. Force your mind to decide what you need
5. Reduce the initial 'scope creep' that delays quick iteration
   - 3 or 4 columns in a table for first draft, not more
   - 3 or 4 tables if possible, to get first iteration 'live'
   - breadth before depth, get the body parts alive and working, then get fancy

# the Yin and Yang of it

We constantly battle the need to develop something fast, and the need to carefully plan our development.

![](https://personaltao.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/yinyang.gif)

## Yin:

Getting 'something' working quickly, helps you get to your 2nd iteration sooner, where key insights await.

## Yang:

Coding immediately after conceiving an idea, could actually slow you down as you get lost in a rabbit hole, or stuck trying to make something work, which you end up abandoning.

## CREATE YOUR SEED FILE

Once you have documented what you need for tables, column names and relationships, use this template for creating a seed file. It will be easy to update with any changes you make to your model. And with the rake task below, you can "flush the database toilet" as many times as you want, any time during the project for clarity while developing.

### [Ruby seed file template for Rails App](https://gist.github.com/smithWEBtek/506d596277e4f5c5ec1cb40826946253)

- The template has 2 parts for each database table.
- The DATA_table_name variable, creates a Hash with keys for each column name, and a key for the sample data that matches the columns. You can edit the column names and sample data easily whenver you need to change your database.
- The other part is the Ruby method you run to create each new row in the database. It parses the DATA_table_name variable, creating each row.
- Finally, the seed file will have a master method for calling each of the "make_Data" methods. And a call for the master method to run at the bottom, to respond to your "rake db:migrate" command.

```ruby
def main
  make_diets
  make_groups
  make_foods
  make_users
end

main
```

The user can either enter their address in a form and have it geocoded to the map, or vice-versa, they can click on the map to populate the address form. Once the form is completed, the user can choose from 3 options: Support, Oppose or Undecided. The voter preference will then be stored in the database, with an appropriate map marker colored by their choice:

Yellow = Undecided
Red = Oppose
Green = Support

A live reloading D3 bar chart represents the current counts of the 3 voter preference groups.

## Configuration and Setup

- Ruby version: 2.4.4

- System dependencies: Gemfile contains required dependencies.

- Configuration:

  - This is a Rails app in API mode, to provide data for the Voter Preference app.

- Database creation:

  - Postgresql requires database creation, which is included in a custom rake tasks below.

- Database initialization:

  - To create the database, migrate the tables, seed the database and start your local Rails server, please run:
    `$ rake db:dcms`
  - see this task here: `app/lib/tasks/dcms.rake`

  - To do the same steps after deployment to Heroku, please run:
    `$ rake db:hdcms`
  - see this task here: `app/lib/tasks/hdcms.rake`

- How to run the test suite

  - Currently there is not a test suite

- Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

- Deployment instructions

  - The app is comprised of 2 github repositories, 1 for the client, and 1 for the api.

  [CLIENT](https://github.com/smithWEBtek/voter-preference-client)

  [API](https://github.com/smithWEBtek/voter-preference-api)

## Setup notes

- `index.html` has required dependencies in CDN link tags

- the Leaflet JavaScript library is included as physical files in the directory structure, (but could also be a CDN link if preferred).

- `index.html` has script tag link to `map.js`

- the files `composer.json` and `index.php` are present for ease of deployment to Heroku, otherwise these 2 files have no functional effect on the app.

- `Bulma` is used as a css library for ease of quick deployment, with a responsive, clean layout

- `map.css` has any custom css that is required

- Here.com is used for geocoding and reverse geocoding

- D3 is used for live data visualization

## Display

The `index.html` page has 4 areas:

1. `nav bar`
2. `map div`
3. `voter preference form`
4. `D3 data visualization bar chart`

## Voter Interaction Flow

1. The `app response div`, shows Voter prompts & app responses

2. The map is centered on Boston geocode with zoom level 12
   `([42.358056, -71.063611], 12)`

3. The `confirm address` button is grayed out, non-functional until the form contains a validated street address.

4. The `voter preference form` is grayed out and not functional until an API validated, Voter-accepted address appears in the `address form`, (which activates the `voter preference form` (step #7).

5. The Voter is prompted with 2 options for address validation with a default message in the `app response div`

   OPTION 1: ENTER ADDRESS in `address form`

   - The address is auto-completed as the Voter types, using an API call to the `here.com` api.
   - Voter chooses correct address from API responses, or
   - Voter continues editing the `address form` until the api returns a valid address.
   - Voter clicks `confirm address` button.
   - Valided address appears in the `address validation div`.

   OPTION 2: MAP-ZOOM-CLICK on address location

   - Voter clicks map and coordinates are captured by JavaScript.
   - An API call is made to HERE.com to find a street address that is closest to, and within 150 meters of, the "Voter-clicked" location coordinates.
   - The Voter accepts the returned street address by clicking `Confirm Address` button.
   - The Voter rejects the returned address and is prompted to ENTER ADDRESS or MAP-ZOOM-CLICK on location
   - Voter clicks `confirm address` button.
   - Required section of the address form turns GREEN

6. When a valid address appears in the `address validation div`:

   - A JavaScript class Object of `Voter` is instantiated with the validated address and geocode information.
   - The `voter preference form` is activated and javascript starts listening for the `Submit Preference` button click

7. Voter Submit Preference

   - Voter clicks radio button in `voter preference form`
   - support / opppose / undecided

8. The Voter Object is updated with the chosen preference and saved to the PostgreSQL database.

9. The map is updated with a colored map point icon based on the Voter's preference
   - Green = Support
   - Red = Oppose
   - Yellow = Undecided

## Views

- The app includes 3 views including Boston, New England and US national view.

- The map displays the entire voter database table, with markers colored by the preference of each individual voter

- A D3 bar graph shows a visual representation of the data

**Find resources that work for your learning style.**

- Videos, books, pdfs, blogs.
- Seek out expert courses on Udacity, Udemy, Coursera, SitePoint, Tutsplus, etc.
- Find a teacher that you can relate to and dive into the topic.

**Get conversant with HELLO WORLD in that topic.**

- Make repos and push your code as you work the course.
- Make folders that match the chapters/sections/modules, so you can come back to it for working code, (this technique put me over the top in a technical challenge to win a job, while I was under time pressure. The code I saved was there to refresh my mind, even though I did not go super deep first time around).

**IMPROVISE a little on the topic, build something that works.**

- Tie the topics (coding this thing to talk to that thing) together in the most basic way that works.

**Divide and conquer, Hello World.**

- There are going to be defined sections of the tech stack you are dealing with.
- Together they look too daunting.
- Separate them and get basic hello world versions working.

**Start a list of questions you can't solve immediately.**

- These are your talking points with senior devs at lunch, hackathons or coding groups.
- Example: I've tied this thing to that thing and they "talk" so far, but I cannot see how to implement "this other thing". Do you have any ideas I could pursue?
- This shows them you've done some work and are not just asking for tech support like a whining end user. It also touches their creative mind and hopefully the nurturing instinct to help you out a bit.

**The best thing you can do is make a list of 20 ways to attack this, then start doing that list.**

- It will put your creative mind and energy into action.
- Fight for a foothold on each technical topic, however small, it is a victory.

**Skim through documentation and tables of contents first, getting the big picture of how things are put together.**

- Then get specific about making "hello world" work for that topic.
- If you end up with 3 or 4 courses to do, dig in and code everything the instructor codes.
- Don't do this for 20 topics, but do it for the top 3.

**Periodically go back and skim the table of contents or master list of topics.**

- For the top 3 and for the entire 20, skim and get big picture
- Keep your mind threading on both the big picture, as well as getting "hello world" to work.

**Many seemingly difficult technical topics boil down to some setup, boilerplate, configuration and specific syntax to tie things together.**

- The big picture thinking allows you to ask simple questions, which get you started.
- Tutorials and videos are often a good way to just get your sense of balance in a particular topic.

**Work like it all depends on you, getting something basic to work.**

- Then have the sense and humility to ask for help based on your work.
- Finally, if you do these things and still "fail", you have at least demonstrated the grit and determination to work at it, which is an irresistible quality that is hard to find.

# Onboarding as a Contractor

### by Brad Smith

## intro

This article covers some basics for onboarding with a new client team, as a software engineer contractor. We will look at the people, resources and dynamics involved in successful onboarding and provide thought points to reference as you onboard.

## Why you are there

There are many reasons why contractor roles exist. Most of the time you are being brought in to solve a problem for the client, provide temporary staff augmentation or to be an added resource on a specific project. These are all happy reasons why a client would take on a contractor.

Conversely, there are situations which are not so happy in their origin, due to issues within the client organization, unsuccessful projects, people leaving unexpectedly, or poor performance of “the last contractor we had ...".

Whether the situation is a happy one or not, you have to navigate carefully, listen, watch, take good notes and balance your initiative with diplomacy.

If you are introverted and less communicative by nature, there are deliberate actions you can take to facillitate communcation.

## Who's Who

Notice that we did not begin with “Whats's What”.
Identifying the key players within your client organization is crucial, because you need to foster relationships for everything else that follows.

Make a list of leadership, management, team leads, people with specific skills. Start watching their work styles, schedules and how they communicate. This will help you get in sync with them for crucial communication and collaboration. Further in this article I recommend keeping a "dev log", and at least capturing the basic information about your client team.

## Get Set Up

This is about getting setup to work, with repos, credentials, access, “add me to this or that”, channels, documentation and tribal knowledge.

Obviously you can't work if these things are not in place. My experience is that there is no perfect onboarding, anywhere (if “perfect” means that you have everything needed, on hour one of day one). Embrace the unfamiliar. Keep track of the things you needed for being fully setup and ready-to-work.

Reasons why:

- You need to be set up and working billable hours as soon as possible.
- You want to have everything needed to get setup on a new machine.
- You want to be ready to help onboard a colleague on the same project, and the client team will likely expect you to have retained that knowledge.
- Client teams are often deep into their code base for many months or years. It is difficult for them to see the project from a new person's eyes. Capturing the details of setup is a valuable contribution to your client team.

## Facts

    You will not have everything you need on day one. Be cool.

Nobody has complete documentation of the app, environment, business logic, you-name-it. You will have to ask for things, repeatedly, diplomatically without complaining.

Onboarding a contractor helps reveal gaps in client documentation and processes. The more you can roll with it and keep working positively, the better.

    If there is documentation, it's probably outdated. Again, be cool.

Be aware of client team dynamics. They might be stressed for many reasons. They might have had very little help when they started working there. You might be coming in to do something they were not able to do. Stay calm and present your requests as friendly and non-threatening as possible.

## Quick Wins

The idea here is to get a positive result for your client as soon as possible.
Obvious, right? This does not have to be a major release game-changing pull request.

    If you “get” me, I automatically like you.

It is human nature to seek to be “understood”. As an outsider coming in to an organization, the one thing you can do is show respect and acknowledge others genuinely. Sincerely try to understand what people are saying and their feelings.

    Help the Universe by understanding your fellow human being.

This enables frank communication and collaboration.
It translates into a perception of competence, giving you the benefit of the doubt early on, but only if you are sincere in your efforts to understand others.

Small wins that build the relationship:

- getting a closer communication with key players.
- showing that you are listening by the questions you ask
- getting clarity on resources, application flow, business rules, known issues

Notice that the quick wins start with the people first. Be aware of where you stand with the client team. It is not enough to just code a solution.

    Communicate reliably, even if you don't have perfect news.

    Don't make your client chase you for updates and status.

## The Tidy Question

This is about creating a solid question to ask a more experienced developer.
Following the debugging points below will help you:

- get clarity before you ask for time from another developer.
- stay focused on the errors and steps you've taken.
- be ready to get effective help when the opportunity arises.

  Most experienced people are happy to help you, especially if they can see you've tried.

## Debugging Points

When things are broken and I'm stuck, I use this five step process to get unstuck:

1. goal: My goal is **\_\_\_**
2. errors: The error I get is **\_\_\_\_**
3. tried: I have tried to **\_\_\_\_**
4. positives: Positives are **\_\_\_**
5. solution: The solution was **\_\_\_\_**

goal:

```
I am trying to “get data from this endpoint”
```

errors:

```
An error occurred while installing libv8 (3.16.14.19), and Bundler cannot continue.
Make sure that `gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.19' --source 'http://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before
bundling.

Something is preventing me from running Ruby 2.3.7 on Mac OS Catalina
```

positives:

```
The front end client app is almost working.
I was able to access the repo today.
The database is running in the API and not showing errors
I can reach data from the Rails console in the API
```

solutions:

```
Turns out that OpenSSL 1.1 was getting installed by Brew automatically.
I used MacPorts to install version 1.0, which ruby 2.3.7 requires
This allowed bundle to complete without errors
```

## Fail Loudly

Seems counter-intuitive, right? It can actually help reveal issues in the app, spark conversations to clarify things and often helps the client team get clarity on goals with their end users. So this does mean that you delete the production database. It might be that you forge a working solution even if it is not elegant. You might do this just to prove a concept works, and to get feedback on how the client team would normally approach it.
There is an old saying: “you can't steer a parked car”. I would much rather go into a stand up meeting with something that works, even if it is ugly.

## Personality Matters

Programmers are often introverted. Sometimes we need to adapt our communciation style to help another person communicate with us. It is ok to deliberately take actions that get you out of your shell and communicate on meetings. It is ok to “adapt” your communication deliberately.

- before a meeting, create talking points for yourself, e.g.: “things I want to get out of this meeting”
- questions you want to ask
- statements you want to convey
- issues to avoid (know when to shut up)
- relationships, e.g.: “I want to reassure James that I understand his issue”
- relationships, e.g.: “I want to praise Tina for her efforts on XYZ”

The bullet points enable you to:

- quickly summarize things
- remember the essence of your point, allowing verbal improvisation
- keep grounded if you are shy about public speaking

Watch for your openings. Sometimes an agenda is set in the beginning, where you can speak up and let others know that you have points you want to cover.

## Logs

Form the habit of a daily developer log. Make it simple enough that you use it without thinking too much.
I use OneNote simply because it syncs so flawlessly on all my devices. I create simple two-column tables, living in logical pages and sections.

The two column table allows me the most freedom to capture my development day, error messages, events, scripts, etc. I don't try to get too fancy with it, just a date in the left column and brain dump in the right column.

!["dev-log"](https://res.cloudinary.com/smithwebtek/image/upload/v1622724740/blog/dev-log.png)

I also try to keep separate logs for:

- setup log
  - be ready to setup an entirely new machine if needed
  - environment variables
  - scripts
  - urls to dev, test, staging, production
- issues and solutions log
  - put things here that were blockers, or key breakthroughs to setup
  - everyday errors go in the dev log
- client info
  - about, business model, what they do
  - who's who
  - who can answer what
  - instructions to access the building, or acct info, etc.

## conclusion

- Put people first, “seek first to understand” your client and their business.
- Record your setup steps, be cool if things are not 100% day one.
- Maintain logs for dev, client, setup, issues.
- Create thought points and speak up in meetings.
- Ask tidy questions of experienced devs.

# Essential Learning Concepts

This post is about learning a new thing, and focusing on the actions that produce the value from the new thing.

## Analogy

I do not care to learn how to tune the fuel injectors in my car's engine.

- I put gas in
- I drive the car
- I live my life

However, if fuel injection stops me from driving the car, I either Google how to fix it or hire someone to fix it. Then I put gas in, drive and live my life.

In software, there is no end to the mountains of knowledge you could pursue.

> Did you know there is a [mailing list](https://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/curl-users) dedicated to the `curl` command?

Bill Gates once said: "...build breadth of knowledge over depth of knowlege"
Suffice to say, you can nerd-out on many things.
The [Breadth/Depth Dilemma](https://www.edweek.org/education/opinion-breadth-vs-depth-the-deeper-learning-dilemma/2015/10) is to choose the depth you need for a given thing, while you live your life.

## The Luddites

In 1999 there was a very thick book that covered PC hardware. 464 pages of glorious detail, a surefire cure for insominia. At the time, this thick book was loved by many IT technicians. Had you spent months reading that book in 1999, you would have been highly qualified to service PC hardware of that day.

<img src="https://img.thriftbooks.com/api/images/m/aa6885b983ae66f7edd38f37a8a4681f9a67eb20.jpg" height="100px" />

Today it is a of piece history. If you spent a lot of time learning PC hardware of the late 90s, you might cry in your beer that the jobs of today do not value your talent, just as the [Luddites](https://www.history.com/news/who-were-the-luddites#:~:text=The%20original%20Luddites%20were%20British,robbing%20them%20of%20their%20livelihood.) complained about machine looms taking over their jobs of weaving cloth in the early 1800s.

The same dilemma confronts all of us today, especially in software engineering.
We have to constantly choose where to invest our attention to:

1. Do our jobs as developers
2. Build and maintain our personal skillset / brand

It can be demoralizing as a developer to constantly compare yourself to a guru on a given subject. My goal with this post is to isolate the forces and factors behind going wide or deep on a given subject, based on your own, discerned, evolving `need to know` forces and factors.

    It is OK to NOT know some things, PERIOD.
    It is OK to NOT know some things, YET.
    It is imperative to learn some things, NOW.
    How wide and how deep you go, DEPENDS.

## It's ok to not know some things, PERIOD.

There are things that are not worth your time learning.
There are things that are not even worth bookmarking in your browser. Having [bookmarked thousands of things](https://smithwebtek.com/bookmarks) along my learning path, I can tell you that much of it is rarely used, has changed or can just be Googled again should I need to go there.

My own tendency is to gather and hoard knowledge, links, books, tutorials and minutiae. It comforts me that I've stored these things somewhere. But I am becoming more pragmatic, asking myself if I really need to store everything, or can it be effectively Googled.

    Please forgive yourself for not knowing everything.
    Be confident that you can pick up new skills as needed.

## It's ok to not know some things, YET.

As a software developer, there is a huge ongoing list of things you could/should know.
I will not create a new list here.
Ok, can't resist, here is an [example](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/web-developer-skills).

- **HTML/CSS:** foundational
- **Analytical:** connect the dots from business logic to data model to app
- **Responsive design:** mobile first, basic css, sass variables
- **JavaScript:** language and front end frameworks
- **Interpersonal:** caring, sharing, speaking, writing
- **Testing and debugging:** test frameworks, testing strategies
- **Back-end basics:** security, deployment, api, aws, linux
- **Search engine optimization:** Google Analytics, SEO best practices

The awareness of the major categories of `your list based on YOUR goals` is what is most important. You do YOU. Figure out the meaningful list for your goals. And if you are a web developer in 2020's, you should at least be aware of the major categories that you will encounter in a job.

## It is imperative to learn some things, NOW.

### **_Be aware of the major categories_**

You want to develop this awareness as you journey in your job and personal growth. Watch for major things you need in your skillset and create placeholders for them.

### **_Identify where you want to go deeper_**

This is the list of things:

- that are in your immediate future
- that your job requires for success
- that you are most interested in (life is short, it all becomes dust faster than you know, go for the worthwhile things you enjoy, and hopefully can get paid to do)

### **_Learn YOU and your learning style_**

I have had to develop the ability to quickly scan documentation and determine:

- am I getting a grounding of the basics
- should I read first, or watch an overview tutorial
- what are the key elements
- what commands should I learn
- how to do `hello world` in this subject area
- how does this fit into the developer landscape

In any endeavor, I want to fit this new thing into my personal `tree of knowledge`.

> **_for example_**
> I need to know how to ssh into a linux server, because I need to deploy apps and troubleshoot issues in devops.
> However, I don't need to know how to optimize the memory in a Linux server, YET (maybe never? if I'm focused on front end work?).
> I don't need to know every folder in the server right now, but I do need to know how to ssh in, create users, deploy apps, connect to a database and find and grep the error logs.

> I don't need to know `how to launch a small scale nuclear attack from the command line`, but I do need to know how to navigate, crud files and folders, create scripts, cron jobs and how to use Vim and Nano editors.

### **_your learning style_**

For me the holy grail of learning is where I can go from zero to hello_world to building my desired outcomes using documentation and written tutorials. However, my experience is that I need to attack the problem by a combination of reading, code alongs, code improvisation and videos of experts who narrate their code as they go.

### **_find the teachers you relate to_**

Personally I love the teaching style of [Maximillian Schwartzmuller, of Academind](https://academind.com/) and Udemy.
Max has German as his first language, so his English is very specific both in his usage of words and especially his usage of tone to categorize thoughts as he speaks. He provides essential repetition of concepts covered, so that I ingest the knowledge more readily than if he were to just spew out code. He has a way of communicating the 'why' along with the 'how' while connecting it to things you have just begun to understand.

### **_triangulate your learning_**

Get a second opinion! It is amazing how a concept comes to life when you learn it from different teachers. You'll get new insights while confirming things you've learned from other teachers, which turns into deeper understanding, sooner.

### **_read, watch, code along, improvise_**

No one method of learning works for everyone. Using a variety of good resources creates a multi-brain, visceral learning experience. If a tutorial is not grabbing your attention, or is going too deep in one direction for what you need right now, find more resources. Code along and build mini apps. Practice good Git hygiene along the way, so that when the pressure is on to deploy on Friday at 5PM, your chops are ready!

## Learn the most important parts first

Try to find where the actual value lies in whatever you are learning, and learn the actions that produce that value.

> Users pay for functionality that acheives their goals.
> For the most part, users do not want to pay you for tinkering in your workshop.

> Ultimately, there is a set of tasks that equal success in your job, where the company is your customer. You owe them an earest effort to continually seek out this list and do embrace it.

    Whenever I'm about to do something, I think 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.   -Dwight Schrute

### **_good example: AWS_**

AWS never stops growing in functionality, security layering, interaction and documentation. It has become a discrete study, as if you were learning Java or Golang, AWS is a beast of its own.

So if a job description requires AWS Lambda for example.
Yikes that is a huge thing! But maybe not.

Maybe if you can deploy some code using it, tweak it and get a foothold on how it works, you'll have more confidence when it comes up in an interview, or lands on your task list in a job.

### How to categorize the important parts

Let's explore some high level ideas about learning a `thing` as it pertains to web development

Thinking about coding languages, frameworks, devops, etc.

- Some things are based on syntax and DSL (Domain Specific Language)

- Some things are based on configuration and usage of existing functions/methods from a package, gem or module. (such as Ruby and Gems, or Node and NPM)

- Some things are complete ecosystems that have specific config settings to interact with. (such as GraphQL)

- Some things require mastery/memorization of phrases and snippets so that the tools are in your head, so that you can connect them with problems. (such SSIS for SQL Server)

- Some things only need to be installed, configured and "talked to" from some other thing.

- Some things come in chunks, for example if you learn how SASS variables work and how to integrate it with BEM styling, you pick up a whole world of expertise with a few basic learnings. Contrast this with learning Go or Python for the first time, you'll have a longer ramp up to get conversant and productive.

  Knowing this, you can trouble-shoot things based on a minimal understanding, simply because you have understood how a thing fits, how to talk to it, how to configure it, where to find the magic functions it provides and the end result you need from it.

---

## conclusion

We all have `imposter syndrome` to some degree. It would be impossible to not have it given the huge buffet of technologies we deal with, combined with any level of personal integrity.

I think that clients, bosses and coworkers will give you the benefit of the doubt if:

- you are sincerely growing your awareness and prioritizing of the various lists
- you are nimble about refining where to put your attention
- you are always working on improving both your breadth of awareness and your depth on the right things that matter most in your goals and job
- and most of all you are communicating sensibly about blockers and current understanding

In my past I have played music with a few world-reknowned musicians. My experience is that the best players are the most receptive to helping you, given your sincere efforts, humility and ability to take suggestions.
